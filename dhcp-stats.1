.TH DHCP-STATS 1
.SH NAME
dhcp-stats \- DHCP traffic statistics generator 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBdhcp-stats \-r\fR <filename> <ip-prefix> [<ip-prefix>[...]][-s]
\fBdhcp-stats \-i\fR <interface-name> <ip-prefix> [<ip-prefix>[...]][-s]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.nf
\fBDhcp-stats\fR generates statistics of network prefix traffic based on ammount of allocated IP addresses.
When prefix traffic is more or equal to 50%, informs using syslog server and STDOUT.
.fi
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-r\fR\ <filename>
Create statistics from pcap \fIfile\fR

.TP
.BR \-i\fR\ <interface-name>
Create statistics from traffic picked up from continous listening on the \fIinterface\fR
.br
Currently only ethernet type interface is supported
.TP
<ip-prefix>
Network range for which statistics will be generated. Prefix is in format N.N.N.N/X where N is from range 0-255 and X is from range 0-30.(prefix length of 31 and 32 has no meaning on 32bit long IPv4)
.br
More prefixes can be given, see \fBEXAMPLES\fR
.TP
.BR \-s
Activate stepping mode. Use any keypress to process next packet.

\fB!WARNING! \fR arrow and other keys may input more than 1 character therefore progressing the program accordingly.

By default program progesses automaticaly: 
.br
    Read-from-file mode: stepping every 400ms.
.br
    Read-from-interface mode: stepping every packet as it comes.
